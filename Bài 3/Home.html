    <p><em style="color:brown">Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</em> After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.  <br><br>

        I've started putting up a <a href="slide1.html" target="_blank">slide show </a> of the production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site. If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please contact me.<br>
